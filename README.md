software design basics every software developer should know

# Design Principles vs Design Patterns:
## Design Principles:
    Design principles provides high level guidlines to design better software applications.
    They do not provide implementation guidlines and are not bound to any programming language.
    Ex: Dependency Inversion Principle

## Design Patterns:  
    Design patterns are the solutions given to the commonly occured object oriented programming problems 
    
    Design patterns provides low level solutions related to the implementation of commonly occuring problems.
    in other words, design pattern suggests a specific implementation for the specific object oriented programming problem 
    Ex: Dependency Injection pattern
# [SOLID Principles](https://github.com/venk120soft/software-design-principles/blob/master/SOLID%20principles)
###### Single Responsibility Principle 
    it states that a class should have one and only reason to change.
###### Open Closed Principle Principle 
    it states that a class should be open for extension and closed for modifications.
###### Liskov Substitution Princple 
    it states that Derived types must be substitutable for their base types
###### Interface Segrigation Principle 
    it states that a client should never be forced to implement an interface that he doesn't use
###### Devpendency Inversion Principle 
    it states that Entities are must depend on abstractions not on concretions. 
    It means high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
